### Install the requirements:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    
### Idea:

Since, the json data can be of a gigantic scale, I considered using Python's ijson library, which streams json data as chunks instead as a block.


### Run the code:

    python main.py
    
   ##### Note: 1. The program is built into modules which can be integrated directly into other programs.
   #####      2. A sample data.json file is provided to take care of the structure of data provided.
